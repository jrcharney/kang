kang
====

A Linux from Scratch distro for Raspberry Pi users and eventually anyone else who wants to make Linux awesome


Kang is the sister project of [Kodos](https://github.com/jrcharney/kodos)!  Where Kodos is for Odroid, Kang is for Rasberry Pi.

Kang eventually will automate Mogwai [PiLFS](http://www.intestinate.com/pilfs/about.html) project, assuming he hasn't though of that already.

Other than that, provide a straightforward explaination of how Cross-Compiling works.

Kang is designed to help with Kodos development as I have a feeling the Odroid instructions may be out of date or using other packages that are non-standard.  I also feel like I'm getting ahead of myself.
