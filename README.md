====

A Linux from Scratch distro for Raspberry Pi users and eventually anyone else who wants to make Linux awesome


Kang is the sister project of [Kodos](https://github.com/jrcharney/kodos)!  Where Kodos is for Odroid, Kang is for Rasberry Pi.

Kang eventually will automate Mogwai [PiLFS](http://www.intestinate.com/pilfs/about.html) project, assuming he hasn't though of that already.

Other than that, provide a straightforward explaination of how Cross-Compiling works.

Kang is designed to help with Kodos development as I have a feeling the Odroid instructions may be out of date or using other packages that are non-standard.  I also feel like I'm getting ahead of myself.

Today being Wednesday the 17th of December 2014, I want to complete this project in 48 hours in time for a local coding event on Friday.

# How to build a hacktop
## Introduction
Before I started using my ODroid as my primary Single-Board Computer (SBC), I used a Rasberry Pi B.  With the introduction of the Rasberry Pi B+, creating a hacktop is so much better.

## What you'll need for this project:
* Rasberry Pi B+
* A Motorola Atrix Lapdock (search eBay!) (Don't get the Motorola 100 or 500 Lapdock.  I think the Lapdock for the Motorola Droid Bionic should be OK. The only difference is that the Atirx and Bionic's microUSB and microHDMI ports are on different sides.)
* 16 GB SD card or larger (8 GB is NOT enough; you can get it cheap at MicroCenter) with a Kang image loaded on it.
* Wifi Dongle (I find Trendnet's N150 to be discreet as well as good enough for any Raspberry Pi or ODroid project.)
* A roll of black industrial Velcro
* 6 to 8 inch USB male (USB male A) to microUSB female cable. (See note below.)
* 6 to 8 inch HDMI male to microHDMI female cable. (See note below.)
* 6 to 8 inch microUSB male to USB male (USB male A) cable. (See note below.)

The last three items on this list will be hard to find, but it is important that you do not go on to eBay to get them.  With things like ["Rubber Duck"](https://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/usb-rubber-ducky/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) devices that could easily be embedded into questionable products, most of them becoming more Chinese in origin, especially for computers, as a security caution, it would be best to stick with a reputable dealer either in the United States or within your own country. (Assuming your country isn't being a jerk about electronic privacy.  A trip to [EFF.org](https://eff.org/) might help.)  I'm trying to think of where is a good spot to get these items.
